# rust-am-clients
A repository for client implementations written in Rust that interact with Attestation Manager (AM) and Attestation Service Provider (ASP) servers.

Corresponding AM servers are implemented [here](https://github.com/ku-sldg/am-cakeml) and extracted from formal specs [here](https://github.com/ku-sldg/copland-avm).

Corresponding ASP servers are implemented [here](https://github.com/ku-sldg/asp-libs).
